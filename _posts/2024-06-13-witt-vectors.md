Today I'd like to discuss Witt vectors. Fix throughout a prime \\(p\\).

## Teichm√ºller lifts

Let us begin with something less fancy. Let \\(O\\) be a complete DVR with residue field \\(k\\) of characteristic \\(p\\). Then:

**Proposition 1**: There exists a unique multiplicative section \\(\omega:k \to O\\) of the natural projection. 

I'll take a slow approach to this. Note if \\(\omega\\) is any multiplicative section then \\(\omega(\lambda)= \omega(\lambda^{1/p^n})^{p^n}\\). This is actually enough to uniquely determine \\(\omega\\): any two representatives of \\(\lambda^{1/p^n}\\) differ by an element of \\(\mathfrak m\\), but once we take \\(p^n\\)th powers, this difference `shrinks'. More precisely:

**Proposition 2**: Let \\(U_n=U_n(\lambda)\\) be the set \\(\\{x^{p^n} \mid x \in q^{-1}(\lambda^{1/p^n})\\}\\). Then \\(U_n\\) has diameter \\(\le \mathfrak m^n\\). 

This follows from the elementary

**Claim**: Let \\(a,b\in O\\) and \\(k \ge 1\\). If \\(a \equiv b \mod \mathfrak{m}^k\\) then \\(a^p \equiv b^p \mod \mathfrak m^{k+1}\\). 

_Proof_: Note that \\(a^p-b^p = (a-b)\cdot \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a^i b^{p-1-i}=: (a-b)c\\), so we just need to show that \\(c\in \mathfrak m\\). And \\(c \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}a^i a^{p-1-i}= pa^{p-1} \equiv 0 \mod \mathfrak m\\) since \\(p \in \mathfrak m\\). \\(\square\\).

Now \\(\omega(\lambda)\\) belongs to \\(\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} U_n(\lambda)\\). But this intersection is a singleton by separatedness (?) and completeness, which means that \\(\omega\\) is uniquely determined and in fact we can _define_ it by \\(\\{\omega(\lambda)\\}=\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty}U_n(\lambda)\\).

There's an easy characterisation of the image of \\(\omega\\): it is the set \\(S\\) of elements which are \\(p^n\\)th powers for all \\(n\\). Clearly the image is contained in \\(S\\), and for the other direction, note that if \\(x = y^{p^n}\\) then \\(x \in U_n(q(x))\\), and if this holds for all \\(n\\) then \\(x \in \bigcap U_n(q(x)) = \\{\omega(q(x))\\}\\). 

Given this characterisation, it follows that \\(\omega(\lambda\mu) = \omega(\lambda).\omega(\mu)\\), since each side lies in \\(S\\) and \\(\omega\\) is injective, being a section of \\(q\\).

**Remark** When \\(k=\mathbf F_p\\), the Frobenius is the identity, so one sees easier formulae in that case, such as \\(\omega(x)=\lim_{n \to \infty} x^{p^n}\\).

**Example** Consider the case of the p-adics \\(\mathbf Z_p\\) with residue field \\(\mathbf F_p\). Then \\(\omega\\) provides a (multiplicative) bijection between \\(\mathbf F_p^\times\\) and the \\((p-1)\\)st roots of unity in \\(\mathbf Z_p\\).

## Witt vectors

Let me now move onto a more general and related construction - the formation of _Witt vectors_. This seems a tricky topic to motivate in general.

We'll set up \\(W(A)\\). I'd like to explain the strategy of proof.

**Definition** Define \\(\Phi_n \in \mathbf Z[X_0,\dots,X_n]\\) by \\(\Phi_n(a_0,\dots,a_n)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}p^i X_{i}^{p^{n-i}}\\). Slightly abusively, if \\(a = \\(a_0,\dots,a_n)\\) or some sequence \\((a_0,a_1,\dots)\) we will write \\(\Phi(\mathbf a)\\) for \\(Phi(a_0,\dots,a_n)\). We can put these together to form \\(\Phi_A: W(A) \to \mathbf A^N; \mathbf a \mapsto (\Phi_i(\mathbf a))_{i=0}^{\infty}\\).

I find these formulae a little hard to motivate. One thing to note, though, is that if \\(p=0\\) in \\(A\\), then the above map is simply \\((a_i)_{i=0}^{\infty} \mapsto (a_0,a_0^p,a_0^{p^2},\dots).\\). So \\(\Phi_A\\) should roughly turn pth powers into shifts. We'll actually find a lift of Frobenius \\(F\\) on \\(W(A)\\) such that \\(\Phi_A F = f_A \Phi_A\\) where \\(f_A\\) is a left shift.

It'll be important to work out \\(\Phi's\\) image. By going inductively, we're basically interested in seeing what conditions we need to find \\(a_n\\) with \\(\Phi_{n}(a_0,\dots,a_n)=u_n\\).

Note that \\(Phi_n(a_0,\dots,a_{n-1},X_n) =\Phi_{n-1}(a_0^p,\dots,a_{n-1}^{p})) + p^n X_n\\) (*)

**Proposition** \\(\Phi_A\\) is injective if \\(p\\) is not a zero divisor in \\(A\\)

_Proof_ From (*) we see that if \\((u_k)_{k=0}^{\infty}=\Phi_A(a)\\) then each \\(a_n\\) is uniquely determined by \\(a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\\). \\(\square\\).

**Proposition** Suppose \\(A,\sigma\\) is a ring with a lift of Frobenius and put \\(u_{n-1}=\Phi_{n-1}(a_0,\dots,a_{n-1})\\). TFAE:
1) There is \\(a_n\\) with \\(u_n=\Phi_{n}(a_0,\dots,a_n)\\)
2) \\(u_n \equiv \sigma(u_{n-1}) \mod p^n)

Hence \\(\Phi\\)'s image is the set of sequences \\((u_n)_{n \in \mathbf N}\\) where \\(\sigma(u_n) \equiv u_{n+1} \mod p^{n+1}\\).

_Proof_ Let's use the above observation. Existence of \\(a_n\\) is therefore equivalent to \\(u_n \equiv \Phi_{n-1}(a_0^p,\dots,a_{n-1}^{p}) \mod p^n\\). However, since each \\(a_i^p \equiv \sigma(a_i) \mod p \\) (by definition), \\(\Phi_{n-1}(a_0^p,\dots,a_{n-1^{p}}) \equiv \Phi_{n-1(\sigma(a_0),\dots,\sigma(a_{n-1}))}=\sigma_{n-1}(u_{n-1}) \mod p^n\\). So existence of \\(a_n\\) is equivalent to \\(u_n\equiv \sigma(u_{n-1}) \mod p^n \\), as claimed. \\(\square\\)

Now the above is very useful. Take \\(A = \mathbf Z[\mathbf X,\mathbf Y]=\mathbf Z[X_i,Y_i \mid i \in \mathbf N]\\), which has a lift of Frobenius determined by \\(X_i \mapsto X_i^p, Y_i \mapsto Y_i^p\\). The elements \\(\Phi_A(\mathbf X)+\Phi_A(\mathbf Y), \Phi_A(\mathbf X)\Phi_A(Y)\\) lie in \\(\Phi_A(A)\\) and so we find (unique!) polynomials \\((S_n),(P_n)\\) with \\(\Phi_A(S)=\Phi_A(\mathbf X) + \Phi_A(\mathbf Y)\\) and \\(\Phi_A(P)=\Phi_A(\mathbf X)\Phi_A(\mathbf Y)\\). Arguing similarly for \\(A=\mathbf Z[\mathbf X]\\) we find \\(I=(I_n)\\) with \\(\Phi_A(\mathbf I)=-\Phi_A(\mathbf X)\\).

We can use this `universal' case to define addition, multiplication and taking inverses on \\(W(A)\\) for _arbitrary_ \\(A\\): put \\(a+_{W(A)}b= S(\mathbf a,\mathbf b)\\) and \\(a \cdot_{W(A)}b= P(\mathbf a, \mathbf b)\\). [...]

**Theorem** The binary operations defined above provide \\(W(A)\\) with a ring structure such that \\(\Phi_A: W(A) \to A^\mathbf N\\) is a homomorphism.

_Proof_: This is a clever use of functoriality and `universal cases'. Let \\(B:=\mathbf Z[(X_a)_{a \in A}]\\). As usual, this has a lift of Frobenius \\(\sigma\\) and \\(p\\) is not a zero divisor, but there is also a natural surjection \\(\varphi:B \to A\\).

Now \\(\Phi_B:W(B) \to B^\mathbf N\\) is injective and its image is a subring of \\(B^\mathbf N\\). Corestricting \\(\Phi_B\\) to its image, we see that \\(W(B)\\) actually has the addition, multiplicatio etc. transferred from \\(B^\mathbf N\\) via the bijection \\(\Phi_B\\), and so forms a ring itself.

As for \\(A\\) itself, all relevant identities follow from those in \\(W(B)\\) via \\(W(\varphi))\\). \\(\square\\).


### Frobenius and Verschiebung

Thus far we've mostly neglected a piece of extra structure. We want to endow \\(W(A)\\) with a lift of Frobenius \\(F\\) and another operator \\(V\\) known as the Verschiebung (German: \\(\simeq\\) displace, shift).

These formulae are slightly odd. We have \\(f_A:A^\mathbf N \to A^\mathbf N\\) which is a left shift \\((a_i)_{i=0}^{\infty} \mapsto (a_{i+1})_{i=0}^{\infty}\\). Again this gives \\(F\\) with \\(\Phi_A F_A = f_A \Phi_A)\\).

**Proposition** \\(F_A\\) is a lift of Frobenius.

We omit the proof as it is similar: reduce to polynomial rings and check \\(f_A\\) is a l.o.F. on \\(\Phi_A(A)\\). \\(\square\\).
